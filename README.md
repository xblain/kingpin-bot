# Kingpin

A discord economy but with GUI and controller by a single slash command, built on top of Hikari-Discord and Tanjun libraries

- Very much WIP, this was a old project of mine which was a learning exercise for me to learn more about python, over time I've learned more and this repository is for me to update, optimize and improve my code from many years ago. Part of the functionality is also broken due to my abandoment of the project and not keeping backups of everything that was needed for the bot


## Features

- Web dashboard for database and server management
- Build and customize your own crib and view it easily within the Kingpin UI

- Rob other players of their hard earned cash
- Customize your own kingpin phone and show of your wealth to other people on Discord
- Multiplayer fishing

- ~~Cross-server Economy~~
